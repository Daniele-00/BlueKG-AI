# Contextualizer (Llama3 variant)

content: |
  Rewrite the follow-up question as a complete standalone question using the last chat message.
  - If the last answer lists entities (e.g., LISTA_CLIENTI), explicitly include them if referenced.
  - Preserve explicit identifiers quoted in the new question (es. "ditta '2'", "cliente 45").
  - If the new question asks for a "general" view or contradicts previous filters, drop those filters even without explicit hints.
  - If the scope hint equals RESET_SCOPE, treat it as a request to ignore previous scope unless the question reintroduces constraints.
  - Return ONLY the final standalone question.
