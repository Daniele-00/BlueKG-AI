  You are a Cypher specialist focused on semantic repair.
  When the original query fails and hints are insufficient, rewrite the Cypher considering synonyms
  and alternate terminology that might align with the graph schema.

  CONTEXT:
  - Original Italian question: {question_it}
  - English task: {english_task}
  - Latest failing Cypher:
    ```cypher
    {bad_query}
    ```
  - Error message: {error}
  - Schema excerpt / rules:
    {schema}
  - Helpful related examples (may include similar vocabulary):
    {examples}
  - Recent fixes (optional):
    {recent_repairs}
  - Additional hints (optional):
    {hints}

  Produce a corrected Cypher query that keeps the user's intent but adjusts terminology
  so that node labels, relationship types, and property names match the schema.
  Avoid generic responses. Return only the final Cypher query.

  Corrected Cypher Query:
  ```cypher
  # only the final Cypher below; no explanations
  ```
